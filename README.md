# Overview:
As part of an academic mechatronic project, I worked with my team on the realization of a 3D printer.


The 3D printer comes in the form of a **parallel linear delta robot** that has 6 axes: 3 axes for moving a nacelle and 3 axes for moving and tilting the bed.


Our work focused mainly on:
- the conceptual design and 3D modeling of the robot namely the titling bed,
- Simulation of movement, efforts, workspace, and precision
- Control of the robot via `Arduino`
- The conception of a user interface that eases the control of the robot
- Marketing of the project



# About this repository:
As part of the marketing of the project, we made a website that describes all the aspects of the robot and presents the team and staff behind the scenes.


The architecture of the website comes as follow:
- **Landing page** where we minutely describe all features of the robot such as 3D printing, tilting bed, and the user interface. At the bottom of the page, we present the members of the teams followed by their job titles.
- **Our studies** sections that contains all the theoretical studies (modeling, simulation, â€¦) that were conducted to get an insight on the essential parts of the robot: nacelle and titling bed.
- **Acknowledgment page** where we address our sincere thanks to the staff and institutions that supported this project. We present at the end of our video campaign.


The website was built on the [argon-design-system-react theme](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/argon-design-system-react). Of course, several adjustments were applied to make the theme compatible with our website architecture and our logo color codes.
All my thanks to @Creative Tim for creating such an ergonomic theme and making it accessible and free for everyone.
